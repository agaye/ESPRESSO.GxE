#' @title Calculates the sample size required to achieve the desired power
#' @description Estimates by how much the simulated study size needs to be inflated or shrank in order to obtain the specified level of power. The ratio of z-statistic required for desired power to mean model z-statistic obtained indicates the relative changes in standard error required. This cirresponds to relative change on scale and square root of sample size.
#' @param numcases Number of cases when outcome is binary
#' @param numcontrols Number of controls when outcome is binary
#' @param num.subjects Number of subjects when outcome is continuous
#' @param pheno.model Outcome type, 0 for binary and 1 for continuous
#' @param pval Cut-off p-value defining statistical significance
#' @param power Desired power
#' @param mean.model.z Ratio of mean beta estimate over mean se estimate
#' @return A table containing:
#'  \code{numcases.required} Number of cases required to achieve the desired power under binary outcome model
#'  \code{numcontrols.required} Number of controls required to achieve the desired power under binary outcome model
#'  \code{numsubjects.required} Number of subjects required to achieve the desired power under a quantatative outcome model
